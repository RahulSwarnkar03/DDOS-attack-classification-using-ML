🚨 DDoS Attack Classification using Machine Learning

This project leverages machine learning algorithms to detect and classify Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks using network traffic data. It aims to enhance cybersecurity by identifying malicious traffic patterns in real-time.

📌 Problem Statement

DDoS attacks flood networks or services, making them inaccessible to users. Early detection through ML can help in proactive defense mechanisms. This project classifies traffic into normal or DDoS categories based on extracted features.

🔍 Dataset

- Public network traffic dataset (e.g., CICIDS2017 or custom DDoS dataset)
- Features include protocol, duration, source/destination IP, packet size, etc.

🧠 Techniques Used

- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, encoding, feature scaling
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Distribution plots, correlation heatmaps
- Modeling: Trained classifiers like:
  - Random Forest
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - XGBoost
- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC

📈 Results

- Best accuracy: `XX%` (replace with your model score)
- AUC score: `XX`
- Confusion Matrix visualized for each model

📦 Tools & Libraries

- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
